# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions we receive. Please read them all before asking for help in our server.

## Difference between Arcane and Arcane-chan ✨

::: warning
Don't invite both. It will **break** things.
:::

Arcane and Arcane-chan ✨ are the same bot but with a different name and avatar. Just pick one which fits your servers theme!

## Roles aren't assigning

Arcane needs to have the **Manage Roles** permission & be **above** the roles you want Arcane to be able to assign. Arcane will not assign elevated roles. (Roles which have the `Administrator` or `Manage Server` permission)

## Channel not found

Arcane will not let you save an invalid or deleted channel. If your config has deleted channels you will need to set the channel to "None" or select a new channel before the dashboard will let you save.
