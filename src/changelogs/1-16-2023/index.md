# 1-16-2023

A random arcane update appears :magic_wand:

Additions:

You can now restrict users from earning in:
+ threads
+ forum posts
+ text in voice channels

This is especially helpful if you want users to earn xp in your #general  channel but maybe not threads created in your general channel.

+ Arcane can now give xp for running slash commands. This includes arcane's commands **and** other bots.  Of course, toggleable on the dashboard (disabled by default).

+ Voice XP has been released and is no longer in beta or pre-release. We're **VERY** happy with how it works now :smile:

+ Message logs now includes a channel blacklist. You can use this to prevent Arcane from logging messages in your #very-secret-channel.

Changes:
+ `/xp` can now modify levels and xp for users who are not in the server. (This has been rolled out to our premium bot for a few weeks now)
+ The leveling page on the dashboard has been slightly reorganized.
    + Max level has been moved to xp options
    + Settings have been grouped into sections
+ Premium migration from Patreon to our site has been extended to June 1st. Please read #premium-announcements-old
