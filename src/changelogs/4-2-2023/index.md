:spider_web: **DASHBOARD UPDATES** :spider_web:
- The dashboard should now load faster!
- Moderation page has been updated

:clapper: **BEHIND THE SCENES** :clapper:
This update is roughly 2 years overdue and we're so excited to have partially ship it. Right now we've just shipped the changes for moderation and AutoMod but more will come soon (everything will be getting a facelift by the end of the year if not sooner). See <https://medium.com/privy-gg/arcane-2023-updates-fa3264064be7>

:bug: **KNOWN ISSUES WITH UPDATE** :bug:
- `/case` is being a bit funky.
    **No ETA. Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.**

:sob: **REMOVALS** :sob:
- Translations for the moderation plugin have been removed (and eventually the rest of the plugins). We are currently not in the position to support translations for a bit. We may revisit this later this year.
