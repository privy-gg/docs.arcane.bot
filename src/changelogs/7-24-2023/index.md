## Another small Arcane update
This update to arcane includes some minor changes & important bug fixes. I can share that the next big update will include some exciting changes to leveling & some new features

### :wave: Welcomer :wave:
- Fixed some bugs
- Increased maximum welcome reactions from 5 to 10

### 👮‍♂️ Logging 👮‍♂️
- Arcane can now log information about threads & forum channel posts!
    - Creation
    - Deletion
    - Updates such as tag changes, locking, archiving, etc
- Fixed some things with message logs
    - If a member removes an attachment from their message the bot will log it
- Changed some colors

### :rotating_light: Moderation :rotating_light:
- If you have an AutoMod rule set to timeout a user the bot will no longer post the log message twice

### / Commands /
We have updated a lot of the more generic commands

- `/avatar` now shows the member's server avatar if they have one set
- `/userinfo` was updated
- `/roleinfo` was updated

We have a few more things we want to do in the future with these commands ^^

- `/serverinfo` was updated
- Few other small changes were made

(The command list on the website is still slightly outdated. This will be fixed in a future update. Remember you can restrict commands in Discord server settings -> integrations -> Arcane)

### :spider_web: Website & Dashboard :spider_web:
- Fixed your server list not refreshing. May require a logout and login
- Spelling fixes
- Updated some settings descriptions to be more concise
- Updated various pages

### :sparkles: Premium :sparkles:
We are raising the price of new premium subscriptions from $5/mo to $7/mo ($55/y to $75/y or $120 to $130 one time). This will help us be able to continue providing updates and expanding our infrastructure. We have some very exciting new plugins coming in the next few months. Sorry can't share any sneak peeks quite yet

#### What about existing subscriptions?
Existing subscriptions will continue to charge at the existing price until January 1st 2024.

We are offering the ability to upgrade to lifetime for $100 for the next 30 days for existing subscriptions. Please reach out in #premium-support if you would like to upgrade.
