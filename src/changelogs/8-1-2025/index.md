## Youtube Notifications

For years, we've offered generous YouTube notifications. Previously, we set limits of 2 alerts for new servers and 5 for premium servers.

Due to rising operational costs, increased server load from excessive alerts (servers with hundreds of alerts), and the need to ensure equitable access for all users, we've made the difficult decision to apply these limits to grandfathered servers, disabling notifications for servers exceeding the free tier. This step addresses performance bottlenecks caused by some servers running hundreds of alerts, which strained our infrastructure and impacted service quality.

Upgrade to a [Premium](../../premium.md) plan to unlock 5 alerts. Need more? Contact us at `contact@privy.gg` to add additional slots to your subscription.
