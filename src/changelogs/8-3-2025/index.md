## `/xp` limit

Previously, Premium servers would be required to request an increase to their [`/xp` limit](../../plugins/leveling/management#xp-limit). This was slow and inefficient for users and Arcane staff.

As of today Arcane now utilizes a dynamic system which is based on the top members of your server.

Read more about the new dynamic system [here](../../plugins/leveling/management#xp-limit).

### FAQ

#### Does this mean we can't earn past 100?

No, this has never been the case. The max level and `/xp` limit are two different features. Read more [here](../../plugins/leveling/management#max-level-vs-xp-limit)

#### What if I requested a higher limit before this change?

You will keep your previously approved limit and it will scale as more of your members levelup.

#### Can I know what my server's limit is?

No. The dynamic system increases your `/xp` limit based on your top members levels. We will be experimenting with the formula but we do not anticipate significant changes.

#### Can you approve a higher limit than what the dynamic system is providing?

No.

#### I can't set the level of my highest member. Why?

The dynamic system uses the **overall level distribution** of your top members, not just your highest members level.
If only one user is significantly ahead of the rest, your server may not be able to assign levels that high until **other users level up** as well.

#### Has the non-premium limit of 100 changed?

No. We still require a [Premium](../../premium) subscription to set levels past level 100. You can organically earn [infinite levels](../../plugins/leveling/management#max-level-vs-xp-limit).
