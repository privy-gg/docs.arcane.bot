# 1-4-2024

## Various updates over the past few weeks/today
Lots of small fixes, tweaks, & changes based on past and current feedback.

### Website & Dashboard
- Roles & channels are now sorted **alphabetically**. Super annoying being listed semi-randomly
- Updated some various wording to better clarify some settings
- Fixed a bug with leaderboard vanity urls taking priority over server ids
- Leaderboard no longer shows discriminators (the annoying #0 or #1234, etc after your username)
- Added some pages which showcase leveling & moderation. More to come in the future.

### Premium
- Fixed certain in-app subscriptions sending "your sub has been activated" every month
- We've discontinued premium for boosters. We announced this in 2022 and didn't get around to it in 2023

### Bot & Commands (most of these wont roll out until tomorrow or next week)
- Fixed some commands erroring instead of telling you which permissions the bot is missing
- Various small performance changes
