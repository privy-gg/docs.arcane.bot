# Command Settings

## Who can run commands?

Who can run commands depends on the specific command. All of Arcane's [sensitive commands](./list) have individual **permission requirements**. In addition to those required permissions, all members need the "Use Application Commands" permission. To restrict commands further see the next section.

## Restricting command access

You can restrict access to commands by going to your Discord server settings -> Integrations -> Arcane. Slash commands and message commands both respect permissions made here.

**If you're on mobile you will need to use the Discord web app: https://discord.com/app**

## Command types

Arcane offers commands in two different variants:

### Slash Commands

Slash Commands are built into your Discord client. Slash commands are always enabled and cannot be disabled. All of Arcane's commands support slash commands.

### Message Commands

Message commands are sent via messages. Most (but not all) commands support message commands.

The default message command prefix is `!`. You can change the prefix and enable/disable message commands on the [dashboard](../dashboard).
