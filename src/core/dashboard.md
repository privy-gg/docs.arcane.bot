# Dashboard

All of Arcane's configuration is done via our [dashboard](https://arcane.bot/dashboard).

### How do I save?

Most pages will prompt you to save your changes. The following plugins auto save:
- Custom commands
- Role Management

### Permissions

When logging in, you will need to authorize Arcane to access certain data about your Discord account.

| **Permission** | **Reason** |
| - | - |
| Access your username, avatar, and banner | Arcane needs to know who you are |
| Know what servers you're in | Arcane needs to know your permissions in your server list |
| Manage access to its commands in a server | Arcane needs to be able to manage / commands in your server(s) |

### Who can access my server's dashboard?
Members with the `Manage Server` or `Administrator` permisisons can view and change settings on your dashboard.

### I don't see my server
The dashboard periodically refreshes your server list. To force it to update you can logout and login.

### When clicking my server it reload the page
Logout and login.
